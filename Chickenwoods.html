<h3>COOK YOUR MUSHROOMS!!!!!!</h3>
<p>While many edible plants can be consumed safely raw, the same cannot be said for mushrooms, all edible mushrooms must be cooked, often in a certain way, or they will at the very least cause digestive problems, sometimes way worse!<br>In some cases, These mushrooms have been known to cause some problems, of which they are mild reactions. most of the time it would cause swollen lips, but in some cases it can include nausea, vomiting, dizziness and disorientation. It is because of these reasons advised to eat only eat it fresh and young and also to consume in small portions to test how well it sits in your stomach.</p>
