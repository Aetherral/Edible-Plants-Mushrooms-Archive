<p>The Wood Sorrel is one of my personal favorite edible plants.<br>Often mistaken for a clover, it has several heart shaped leaves and can be found in lawns, roadsides, and fields, it is a very versatile plant and can be found in many places. in fact, I actually found some in my backyard last year.<br>here is a photo:</p>
<p>The Wood Sorrel is actually native to all but 6 states in the united states, these being: Nevada, california, Idaho, Hawaii, and Alaska</p>
