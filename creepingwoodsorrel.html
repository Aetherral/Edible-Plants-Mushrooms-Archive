<h4>Scientific name: Oxalis corniculata</h4>
<h2 style= "color: oldlace; margin: 50px">Information</h2>
<p>The creeping wood sorrel is a variant of the Wood sorrel, the difference? location. It is found in more shady places, specifically along the bottom of walls.<br>here is a photo that I took:<br>this one is not fully grown by the way, so when fully grown it would likely have larger leaves</p>
<p>The Wood Sorrel is actually native to all but 6 states in the united states, these being: Nevada, california, Idaho, Hawaii, and Alaska</p>

<p>This one can also be eaten raw, and has a somewhat lemony taste.from what I can tell, it is basically the same in structure as the regular wood sorrel so all of the same recipes work</p>
