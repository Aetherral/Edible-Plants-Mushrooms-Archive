<h4>Scientific name: Trifolium repens</h4>
<h2 style= "color: oldlace; margin: 50px">Information</h2>
<p>ever since I started recognizing the White clover for what it is, so many possibilities have opened up to me. These things are everywhere, my lawn, everyone else's lawn, every major field I have seen.<br>many think these to be a weed, but it is clear to me that that cannot be further from the truth.</p>
<p>The White Clover is found in literally every US state, all but one province of Canada, and Greenland, It is native to europe and is the result of a crossbreed between two earlier clover species.</p>

<p>in addition to being edible, it also can be used to make a healing ointment, being able to help heal small cuts, wounds, sores, and burns</p>
